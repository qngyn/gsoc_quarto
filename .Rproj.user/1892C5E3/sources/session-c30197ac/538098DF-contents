# Introduction

My name is Quynh Nguyen, and I am a student from Case Western Reserve University, majoring in Computer Science and Systems Biology.

I am skilled in Python, JavaScript, and R. I really enjoy to participate in different hackathons or contests to learn more about new frameworks but also practice my understanding. You can view my past projects from those hackathons via my [Github](https://github.com/qngyn). At the moment, I am looking for opportunities to gain hands-on experience via contributing on impactful projects.

You can contact me via my email [quynhnguyen0821\@gmail.com](mailto:quynhnguyen0821@gmail.com), or via my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/quynhnguyen00/)
